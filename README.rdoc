# GLUE

This is a rails application to be used with jeko's biliarduino program. The soccer table manager (biliarduino) will communicate via rest api with the rails app, which will be also reachable via regular html pages to allow user to edit and load their data, to configure the table settings, to view statistics and so on. It's still less than usable, please stay away for now :)
